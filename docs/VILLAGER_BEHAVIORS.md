## Overview

**RealisticVillagers** fundamentally transforms Minecraft villagers from simple trading NPCs into interactive, intelligent human-like entities. Instead of the blocky, basic villager models, they appear as player-like characters with custom skins, equipment, and complex behavioral AI systems.

### Core Philosophy

The plugin replaces "boring villagers" with "interactive humans" by:
- **Replacing the villager model** with player models using custom skins
- **Implementing advanced AI** for realistic decision-making and conversations
- **Adding survival mechanics** like hunger, fatigue, and resource management
- **Creating social systems** for relationships, families, and communities
- **Enabling combat capabilities** with weapons, armor, and tactical behaviors
- **Introducing life cycles** including reproduction, growth, and death/revival

## Visual Appearance Changes

- Limited customization (only profession-based robes)

**RealisticVillagers Behavior:**

  - **Sex** (male/female) - affects skin texture and naming conventions
  - **Age stage** (adult/child) - proper scaling and proportions
  - **Profession** - optional profession-specific overlay textures

  - Shoulder entities (parrots can perch on shoulders)

### Custom Nametags

**Configuration:** `custom-nametags` section

## Trading System Modifications

### Realistic Trade Inventory

**Vanilla Behavior:**
- Infinite trade items
- Magical restocking
- No inventory limits

**RealisticVillagers Behavior:**

**Inventory-Based Trading:**
- Trades only available if items in inventory
- Finite stock based on work-generated items
- Visual inventory inspection via GUI

**Trade Restocking:**
- **Disabled vanilla restocking** (optional)
- **Work-based generation** replaces it
- Villagers must work to generate trade items
- Hunger must be satisfied to work

**Trading Configuration:**
```yaml
# trading-config.yml
realistic-trade-inventory:
  enabled: true
  check-actual-inventory: true
  
work-item-generation:
  enabled: true
  check-actual-trades: true  # Only generate tradeable items
```

**Trading Flow:**
1. Villager works at job site
2. Items generated and stored in inventory
3. Trades become available
4. Player trades items from inventory
5. Inventory depletes
6. Villager must work again to restock

### Trade Filtering

**InventoryTradeFilter:**
- Filters trade offers based on inventory

- Updates in real-time
- Shows only possible trades

**FilteredTradeWrapper:**
- Wraps vanilla trading UI

## Death & Revival Systems

### Death Mechanics

**Vanilla Behavior:**
- Villagers die permanently
- Drop nothing or basic items
- No resurrection

**RealisticVillagers Behavior:**

**Death Handling:**
- **Equipment drops** (weapons, armor, tools)
- **Inventory drops** (optional, default: false)
- **Data persistence** for revival
- **Zombie infection** (optional, configurable)

**Zombie Transformation:**
```yaml
zombie-infection: true  # Converts to zombie villager on zombie kill
witch-convertion: true  # Lightning strike ‚Üí witch
witch-convertion-from-villager-trident: false  # Channeling trident
```

**Death Data:**
- Stores offline data (inventory, equipment, family, etc.)
- Preserves relationships
- Maintains reputation
- Saves skin and appearance

### Revival System

**Cross Item:**
- Craftable revival token

      - STRING, S
    shape:
      - "SIS"
      - "III"
      - "SIS"
```

**Revival Process:**
1. **Preparation**: Give cross item to villager before death
2. **Death**: Villager dies with cross in inventory
3. **Monument Creation**: Totem monument spawns at death location
4. **Revival Ritual**: Player interacts with monument
5. **Resurrection**: Villager respawns with all data restored

**Monument Animation:**
- Multi-block totem structure
- Particle effects
- Sound effects
- Interaction prompt

**Revive Manager:**
- Tracks revivable villagers
- Manages monument locations
- Handles resurrection mechanics
- Restores all villager data:
  - Inventory
  - Equipment
  - Relationships (partner, family)
  - Reputation
  - Skin and appearance
  - Profession and level

**Configuration:**
```yaml
cross-reputation: 10  # Reputation gained for giving cross

revive:
  enabled: true
  monument-duration: 600  # Seconds before monument despawns
  head-item:  # Monument appearance
    material: PLAYER_HEAD
    url: "..."  # Skull texture
```
