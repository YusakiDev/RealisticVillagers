# ====== TOOL INSTRUCTIONS PROMPT ======
# NOTE: This section is no longer used with native tool calling.
# The plugin now uses OpenAI/Groq native function calling, which handles
# tool execution automatically without requiring JSON formatting.
# Tools are defined in the API request and the AI can call them naturally.
prompts:
  tool-instructions: |
    # This field is preserved for backwards compatibility but is not included
    # in the system prompt when using native tool calling.
    # The AI provider automatically handles tool calls through the API.
